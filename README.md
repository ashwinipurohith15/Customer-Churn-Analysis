# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis System

## Project objective

In this project, you will embark on a comprehensive journey through the world of data analytics. Your mission is to build a Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis System, a powerful tool that will allow the business to identify customers who are likely to churn and take proactive steps to retain them. This project will cover everything from data extraction and cleaning to visualization, providing you with a full understanding of the data analytics process.

## Project Components and Workflow:

## Data Extraction and Storage (SQL)

Objective: Design a relational database to store customer data, subscription details, transaction history, and churn status.

- Database Design:

Create tables like Customers, Subscriptions, Transactions, and Churn.

Define relationships between these tables using FOREIGN KEY.

- Data Ingestion:

Use SQL to import data into these tables.

- Querying Data:

Write SQL queries to extract relevant data, such as customer demographics, transaction frequency, and historical churn data.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python Basics and Libraries)

Objective: Use Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean, and preprocess the data for analysis, model building, solve queries, and visualize results.

- SQL Query Resolution in Python:

Solve various SQL queries such as finding customers without subscriptions, calculating average transaction amounts, identifying churn patterns, etc.

Visualize the results of these queries using data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Python Basics and Libraries, Product Analytics)

Objective: Perform EDA to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in the data that could indicate churn.

- Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data inconsistencies.

Normalize and standardize numerical data.

- Data Transformation:

Merge data from different tables (e.g., join Customers and Transactions).

Split the data into training and testing sets for machine learning.

- Feature Engineering:

Create new features such as CustomerLifetimeValue, AverageTransactionValue, LastTransactionDate, etc.

Convert categorical variables into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding.

- Descriptive Statistics:

Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode) for key variables.

Analyze customer demographics, purchase history, and subscription patterns.

- Data Visualization:

Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

Visualize correlations between features and churn using a heatmap.

- Behavioral Analysis:

Identify patterns in customer behavior that lead to churn (e.g., decline in transaction frequency).

Segment customers based on behavior (e.g., high engagement vs. low engagement).

## Data Visualization and Reporting (Tableau & Power BI)

Objective: Create interactive dashboards and reports to visualize churn analysis and customer segmentation.

- Tableau:

Import the cleaned and processed data into Tableau.

Build dashboards that show churn rates, customer segments, and key churn factors.

Create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.

- Power BI:

Connect Power BI to the dataset.

Develop reports that allow stakeholders to interact with the data, filter by customer segment, and analyze churn trends.

Use DAX to create calculated columns and measures for advanced analysis.
